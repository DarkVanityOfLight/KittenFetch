# KittenFetch README

## Overview

KittenFetch is a fun program written in the Zig programming language that generates a cat ASCII art along with a customized user box. 
The cat art is displayed along with a user's hostname and username.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Zig Compiler](https://ziglang.org/download/) must be installed on your system.

### Building the Program

   git clone https://github.com/DarkVanityOfLight/KittenFetch.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Build the program, I suggest going with the ReleaseSmall binary, but it's up to you:
