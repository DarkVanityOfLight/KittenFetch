# KittenFetch README

## Warning
This is the first time working with a low level language, and I'm 99% sure this code is somehow exploitable ;(, so use on your own danger.

## Overview

KittenFetch is a fun program written in the Zig programming language that generates a cat ASCII art along with a customized user box. 
The cat art is displayed along with a user's hostname and username.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Zig Compiler](https://ziglang.org/download/) must be installed on your system.

### Building the Program

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DarkVanityOfLight/KittenFetch.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd KittenFetch
   ```

3. Build the program, I suggest going with the ReleaseSmall binary, but it's up to you:

   ```bash
   zig build 
   ```

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to KittenFetch by opening issues, suggesting improvements, or submitting pull requests. We welcome any creative enhancements to the cat art or additional features.
